# Chapter 11

## CI/CD
- So you have a feature ready to be shipped - what happens next?
    - Do you upload files to a server manually?
    - How do you manage the version of your product running in the wild?
    - How do you make sure it works and roll back to a safe version if it doesn't?

- Doing all of the above manually is a pain and doesn't scale well
